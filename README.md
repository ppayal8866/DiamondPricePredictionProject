# DiamondPricePredictionProject

## Project Name: Diamond Price Prediction using R

## Overview 

Implemented the fundamental Data Visualization techniques for an interesting data set called the diamonds dataset from the Kaggle repository. The dataset[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds] contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. The goal of this project is to predict the price of the diamond based on the other attributes.

## Project description
1. Introduction:

    The Diamond Price Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model using the R programming language to estimate the price of diamonds based on various attributes. Diamonds are precious gemstones, and their prices can vary significantly based on characteristics such as carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, and more. This project will leverage machine learning techniques to create an accurate price prediction model that can benefit both buyers and sellers in the diamond industry.

2. Objectives:

  - Build a robust predictive model for diamond price estimation.
  - Analyze and preprocess a dataset containing information on diamond attributes.
  - Implement feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
  - Evaluate and compare different machine learning algorithms for price prediction.
  - Create a user-friendly interface for users to input diamond attributes and receive price predictions.

3. Tools and Technologies:

 - R programming language
 - RStudio/ R markdown 
 - Machine learning libraries in R (e.g., DAAG, lasso2), dplyr, janitor, corrplot, RColorBrewer, caret)
 - Data visualization libraries (e.g., ggplot2)

4. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

 - Acquire a dataset containing information about diamonds, including attributes such as carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, depth, table, price, and more.
 - Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, outliers, and data integrity issues.
 - Explore and visualize the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of attributes and their correlations.

5. Feature Engineering:

   - Create new features or transform existing ones to capture hidden patterns in the data.
   - Standardize or normalize numerical attributes as needed.
   - Encode categorical attributes using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

6. Model Building and Evaluation:

 - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
 - Build multiple regression models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting) for diamond price prediction.
 - Train and fine-tune the models using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
 - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2).
 - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

7. User Interface:

   - Created a user-friendly interface using Shiny
